# MAGD150
Some of my projects from my MAGD150 class during Spring 2024.

Assignment Three – variables, frameRate, measuring mouse position, and math

This assignment and piece of code incorporates myself experimenting with various functions like frame rate and mouse X and Y. When running the code, you should see two circles, one on screen and one that follows your mouse. The circle following your mouse should be very off-center, however when holding while dragging it should slow down and follow exactly where you drag your cursor.

Assignment Ten – Working with extended libraries in p5.js

This assignment involves me experimenting with the p5.Polar library. This library allows you to create radial patterns, like a kaleidoscope, which I utilized to create a flower. I used the main function the library offers, setcenter, to give the code an exact point of where the center of my code is. After that, I used both polarEllipses and polarTriangle to create the shapes in a radial formation to depict my blue flower.
