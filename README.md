# MAGD150
Some of my projects from my MAGD150 class during Spring 2024.

Assignment Three – variables, frameRate, measuring mouse position, and math

This assignment and piece of code incorporates myself experimenting with various functions like frame rate and mouse X and Y. When running the code, you should see two circles, one on screen and one that follows your mouse. The circle following your mouse should be very off-center, however when holding while dragging it should slow down and follow exactly where you drag your cursor.

Assignment Four – Movement, Mouse, and Conditional Logic  

This assignment includes a function similar to Assignment Three where you have a circle following your cursor, however this one includes pressing on your mouse to get it to center on your cursor along with allowing you to change the color of the circle by pressing any key on your keyboard. The circle should be able to shift from a light green color to black. On the background, there is also a loop of lines drawn across the canvas using the for() function.

Assignment Ten – Working with extended libraries in p5.js

This assignment involves me experimenting with the p5.Polar library. This library allows you to create radial patterns, like a kaleidoscope, which I utilized to create a flower. I used the main function the library offers, setcenter, to give the code an exact point of where the center of my code is. After that, I used both polarEllipses and polarTriangle to create the shapes in a radial formation to depict my blue flower.
